# Airconditioner remote holder case - 3D Model

This is a common problem that we face in daily life. We often need to find the remote when switching on the air conditioner. 
This holder was created for that issue. We can hold the remote in a permanent and easily accessible place.

This repository contains all of the 3D models and files.
